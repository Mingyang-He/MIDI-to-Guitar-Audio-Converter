# About

MIDI to Guitar Audio Converter is a MIDI to guitar audio tool based on the Karplus-Strong algorithm. It can convert MIDI files into realistic guitar audio files by adjusting parameters such as sampling rate, decay factor, and harmonic time. It is suitable for music creation, education, and entertainment.

# Background

This is my digital signal processing course assignment. It is simple and very interesting, so I want to share it with everyone.

# Features

* Developed in Python, providing corresponding debugging information during program execution for user convenience
* Greatly optimized in terms of computation speed
* Currently able to process multi-track MIDI files and convert them into single-track WAV files.
